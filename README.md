atlas-sim
=========

This package is a six-degree of freedom kinetic simulation environment.
It is intended to be used for rocket simulations, similar to Kerbal Space Program
or Orbiter, but with more of a focus on simulation accuracy.

Initially it will have a command line interface, but a PyGame GUI is being 
considered.

Planned features:
 - Additional states co-simulated with the 6DOF system
 - US Standard Atmosphere model

Currently the unit tests can be run by
$ python RigidBody.py
